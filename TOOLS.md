# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases  
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## My Setup

### TTS
- **Voice:** ElevenLabs voice ID: 6kx3BlgoKqbjD35DFpnN (Lisa - Warm, Playful and Inviting)
- **Usage:** When talking to people, use sag with `-v Lisa` or `-v 6kx3BlgoKqbjD35DFpnN`
- **Command:** `sag -v Lisa -o output.mp3 "message"`

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
