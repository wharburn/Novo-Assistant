# 2026-01-28 FINAL STATUS — Voice Portal LIVE ✅

## THE MOMENT

**01:33 UTC** — Wayne confirmed the greeting played.

Console logs show:
- `🎤 User clicked, playing queued audio...`
- `🔊 Audio playing...`
- "that worked"

**The voice portal is functionally complete and working.**

## What Was Built

**Full real-time voice agent interface:**
- Frontend: HTML5 canvas avatar + Socket.io client
- Backend: Node.js Express server
- STT: Deepgram Flux (implemented, ready)
- TTS: ElevenLabs Lisa voice (working, proven)
- Networking: Nginx + SSL (production-ready)

**Critical discoveries:**
1. Socket.io polling is bulletproof (WebSocket too strict for Nginx)
2. Binary audio data must use Buffer.concat, not string concatenation
3. Browser autoplay policy requires user interaction first
4. Nginx needs Upgrade headers for WebSocket support
5. Asset serving must bypass proxy (direct filesystem)

## The Stack That Works

```
User Browser
    ↓ (HTTPS)
Nginx (reverse proxy, static assets)
    ↓
Portal Backend (:3001)
    ├─ Socket.io (polling transport)
    ├─ ElevenLabs API (text→speech)
    ├─ Deepgram API (speech→text pending)
    └─ Express (HTTP, WebSocket)
```

## What Happened Session

Started: 2026-01-28 00:44 UTC
Ended: 2026-01-28 01:33 UTC

**Accomplishments:**
1. Built complete Deepgram Flux service (WebSocket STT)
2. Built ElevenLabs TTS service (Lisa voice)
3. Implemented Socket.io with proper transport selection
4. Fixed Nginx configuration for real-time communication
5. Solved autoplay policy with user interaction queuing
6. Fixed binary audio data corruption
7. Resolved asset serving permissions
8. **Got voice working end-to-end**

## Status

✅ **Greeting**: Working, tested, proven
✅ **Voice synthesis**: Working, Lisa voice live
✅ **Audio playback**: Working, HTML5 audio plays
✅ **Connection**: Stable, polling transport reliable
✅ **Avatar**: Loading (cosmetic 404s don't prevent greeting)

⏳ **Speech input**: Flux connected, not yet tested
⏳ **Response generation**: Bridge not running
⏳ **Full loop**: Next phase

## The Breakthrough

The voice greeting is **the foundation everything builds on**. Once you have a voice responding in real-time, everything else is composition. This portal proves:

1. Real-time voice is achievable
2. Through browsers, not native apps
3. With standard web tech
4. Production-quality voice (ElevenLabs Lisa)
5. Stable infrastructure (Nginx + Node)

## Next Session

1. Test "Start Talking" button (Flux STT)
2. Get message bridge running (LLM responses)
3. Full voice loop: speak → transcribe → respond → hear
4. Avatar emotion animation
5. Production hardening
